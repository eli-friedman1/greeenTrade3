                        <p>Back in 2015 our founder had a thought. How many people have used cell phones that just sit around, or worse end up in land fills? This got him thinking. If we offered a convenient process to pick up used cell phones from those people how would that effect the environment. Well, you are our test subjects. Let's see if together we can make a difference. Let's give this a shot. Together we can reduce the carbon footprint and repurpose old unwanted cell phones while making a little green to boot.</p>
